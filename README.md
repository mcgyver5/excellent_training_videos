# Excellent Training Videos
this is my list.  There are many like it but this one is mine.  
### Guidelines:
* Visuals are clear.  
* Narrator is intelligible.
* Material is up to date and correct.
* not a bunch of fancy transitions or other effects without a good reason
* typos are edited out or kept to a minimum
* warnings or alerts that show up as part of the exercises are explained.
* Don't spend time on unrelated tasks.  For example, don't go over how to install Java when the video is about using a Java tool.
* Don't read off of slides 

### Format:
* Each entry has a title closed in square brackets followed by a URL in parentheses.
* Expect time, ratings, name of creator and other metadata to be automated sometime soon. Until then, the title and link are required while time, creator and ratings are optional.
